# Carbon Emissions problem in India

India produced 2.62 billion metric tonnes of CO_2 in 2019
27.29% of CO_2 is Carbon composition

Hence, 0.7 billion tonnes of carbon per year

Potenial solution -
Using Bamboo as a carbon sequestration sink.

On an average, Bamboo is about 40% carbon by dry weight. (Can vary by species)

1 Square mile of a mature bamboo can produce 160,000 tonnes of bamboo per year.
i.e., 64,000 tonnes of carbon sink per square mile.

We can plan 11,172 square miles of bamboo in India. 
About 8.5% of total area of Rajasthan or 0.9% of total area of India.

Store the dry bamboo pellets in grain storage bins to offset all carbon emissions. 

Assuming average price of a fuel pellet ranges from 3000 to 6000 INR per metric tonne.
Hence, India can produce 1.78 billion tonnes of Bamboo at the cost of $73 to $148 billion per year. 
Economies of scale would act to reduce this cost over a period of time.
